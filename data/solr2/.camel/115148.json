August 11, 1955. Dear Department, You may be interested in a few observations made on a recent flight from Canton to Peking by an experienced diplomatic member of our staff (Buxton) . Canton Airfield The airfield showed no signs of recent development . The only air� craft seen was that on which the observer flew. It had two engines. The number painted on its wing was \"114\". The crew was Chinese. It had 21 bucket seats, in rows of three, with a mall space by the door at the back. The instructions to passengers in the plane were all in Chinese, except those on the safety belts, ifoich were in English. The plane looked like a Dakota. Railways The plane flew along the Wuhan-Cant on railway for about 25 minutes (about one-eighth of the flying time from Canton to Wuchang). At Hengyang it was possible to see the junction of the line to Kheilin and Liuchou at the river junction between the Hsiang and Lei Rivers. It looked like this; Hsiang River Lei River Canton North Only one bridge over the Hsiang River was seen and that was apparently not directly on the alignment of the railway; it was not clear precisely how the railway was carried over the river. (The identification of Hengyang is virtually certain, but the sketch may be inaccurate as it was difficult to grasp the meandering river system. ) Changsha Airfield There was a very obvious and apparently large airfield about 10 miles south of Changsha and on the east bank of the river. It consisted of a white concrete strip aligned north and south with a considerable area of /bare ro Ul U\\ 00 m ro Par Eastern Department, Foreign Office, S.W.l.","image_file":"035844.jpg","image_url":"http://www.archivesdirect.amdigital.co.uk/Documents/Images/115148/7","book_id":"115148"},{"id":"9page","position":9,"hasModel":"Page","image_text":"n n n n o u u u u O END bare red earth around it.

The oniy other aircraft was a similar civil airliner, which left for Shanghai shortly before the Peking plane. Flood and Famine During the last twenty miles or so of the rail journey from to Canton there appeared to be substantial flooding. From the air, hoeever. it did not seem that more than a small amount of land was flooded. There was no sign of flood in Hunan. In Hupeh it was difficult to distinguish between lake and flood, but there did not seem to be serious floods. The Yangtse was not flowing over its banks near Whan.
