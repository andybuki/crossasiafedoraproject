(1384/1/55) June 30, 1955. At the reception last night for the Indian Cultural Delegation, Chou Kn-lai spent almost the whole time before dinner talking to me. The sub� ject of our conversation was exclusively the manufacture of civil aircraft and I used the opportunity to do some propaganda on behalf of Viscounts and Comets. It was surprising how ignorant Chou En-lai was on the whole subject . The conversation began by his summoning me across the room to answer the question whether Convairs were United States or British-made. Ch'en Ti was also in the group at this moment and didn't know the answer either . Chou then went on in a very good-humoured way to say how much the Chinese Government would like to buy civil aircraft from us; and he even cracked some jokes about the embargo, saying that if he bought civil aircraft from us he would give a firm promise that only civilians would travel in them at any time, and also asking whether if we sold aircraft to Burma, we were not afraid that Burma would pass them on to China. I made what I hope were appropriate replies and comments at each point. Another extraordinarily ingenuous question was whether we were manufacturing 4-engined civil aircraft . This gave me an opportunity to say a piece about Viscount, and with Pu Shou-ch'ang's help, to explain the difference between turbo-prop and turbo-jet. He expressed amazement when I told him that the present Prime Minister had gone to and from Geneva last year in a jet-propelled aircraft and called upon Ri Shou-ch 1 ang to bear witness that no one had ever told him this before. I then went on to give him a piece about Comets, drawing on the recent Intel. Chou asked at one moment whether the civil aircraft industry in England was private enterprise or state-controlled. The conversation only ended when Chou En-lai was told that the time had come for him to lead the procession in to dinner. The only reference to Soviet aircraft construction was when Chou En-lai remarked incidentally that the Russians were also now m\"Hm, i-t. - - - - - - ? WV w ? ? KMMrm n ?

August 30, 1955. r ? ^ The information in our telegram No, 812 of August 7 about the presence of six Convairs in China was obtained by me from Brigadier Malik, the Military Attache at the Indian Embassy. In conversation with him and some friendly Western diplomats I had drawn attention to an illustration in \"People's China\" or \"China Reconstructs\" in which a recognisable Convair was shown taking off from the airfield at Shanghai and had commented that so far as we knew the Chinese Civil Aviation Corporation only possessed one Convair. Malik afterwards drew me on one side and gave me the information reported in our telegram under reference. Malik did not himself accompany the Indial Cul� tural Delegation during any part of their tour in China but two other diplomatic members of the Indian Embassy staff did. I have seen a fair amount of Malik since his arrival two or three months ago and am satisfied that he is a sound staff- officer who would not make a positive assertion of this kind without first carefully checking the reliability of the evidence. We have of course discussed among ourselves here possible ways in which the Convairs might have reached China. The only possible clue, if indeed it rates as such, is Chou En-lai's jocular reference to the possibility of civil aircraft reaching China through Burma which I reported in my letter No. 1384/1/55 x j of June 30, though you will see from the same letter that Chou ^ professed not to know whether Convairs were American or British.
