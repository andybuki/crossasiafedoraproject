From the many enclosures to the Provincial Government's letter (which I also enclose) it appears that the accident has been investigated in great detail here. It is firmly stated, and the case for compensation is based on the contention, that the fishing vessel was properly lighted at the time of the collision. This statement however conflicts with that of the Master of the \"Pyrrhus ', whose report you have no doubt received. 4* I hope to have the opportunity of discussing this case with the Hong Long authorities and with the Hong Kong representatives of Messrs.

Taiwan provincial Government, Taipei, Taiwan. Deo ember 2, 19D4. Sir, I have the honour to refer to your letter No. 460/1/24/54 of June 25 in reply to a letter from Mr. Teal Wen-yu, Chairman of the Taiwan Pishing Association, on the subject of the collision of the British vessel 8.3. \"Pyrrhus\" with a Formosan trawler, \"No. 3 Shun Hslng,\" on June 4th 1964. In that letter you stated that the British shipping authorities had been requested to investigate the Incident, and asked that full details, a list of damage suffered by the trawler, and a copy of a document written by the Master of the British vessel be sent to you through this Government . 2. After the accident, an on-the-spot investigation was held jointly by the Fishery Administration of the provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, the Hsln-chu Helen Government and other authorities concerned and the findings, together with photographs showing the fishing boat in its damaged condition ( see enclosure A), a report made by the owner of the fishing boat ( see enclosure B) and a list of damage to the equipment and possessions of the fishing boat ( see enclosure C) , were submitted to this Government. The master of the fishing boat was also asked, in accordance with the maritime law and other relevant Chinese regulations, to submit a maritime report (see enclosure D) to the Maritime Committee of the Keelung Harbour Bureau for deliberation according to law and regulations. The verdict ( see enclosure K) reached by the Committee after an investigation had been made by the experts, and the minutes of two maritime interrogations ( see enclosure F) , were presented to this Government through the Keelung Harbour Bureau on August 6th. 5. As is evident from the verdict reached and from the investigations made by the various authorities and experts mentioned above, the fishing boat, prior to the collision, was not in fact an \"unllghted vessel\" as alleged by the master of the British vessel 3.8. \"Pyrrhus\" in his document written in English ( see enclosure O). According to the testimonials by the chief of the Nan-llao Li, Hein-chu City, and the rescuing fishing boat desnatched by the Hein-ohu Helen Fishery Association (see enclosure H) , the light on the outside of the master's cabin was still not extinguished. The minutes of the maritime interrogations made by the Keelung harbour Bureau during the investigation also recorded that the fishing boat was lighted and engaged in fishing when the collision occurred. The Bureau declared, after completing the investigation which was conducted by experts, that* \"The fishing boat's front light ana the aft light support were still there and electric wiring and switches remained intact. The two batteries were also examined and found to be still charged with electricity. The navigation experts who studied the maritime report of the fishing boat and the minutes of interrogations upon Invitation by this Bureau were all of the opinion that it was Impossible to prove that the fishing boat was not lighted at that time. And according to Kang Uheng-chun, master of the fishing boat \"Tal-yu No. 6\" who himself saw it, many small line-fishing vessels were engaged in fishing on the sea near Hala-ohu on that night ( all vessels were lighted) and the weather was clear with extensive visibility.

The unfortunate collision with the fishing boat \"No. 8 iihun Hslng\" must be due to negligence on the part of the British vessel.\" It thus appeared from these findings that the allegation by the master of the 8.8. \"Pyrrhus\" that the fishing boat was at that time an \"unllghted vessel\" was not true to fact. As the document given by the master of the British vessel was written In English, the master and the crew of the damaged fishing boat, who were not conversant with the English language, were unable to voice immediately their objection to the point in question. 4, it will be recalled that the British Government invited the Republic of China and other nations in 1948 to a conference in London where \"The International Regulations for Preventing Colli� sions at Sea 1948\" were drafted. These regulations were subse� quently adopted by the various governments and put into force on January 1st, 1964. Rule 86 of the Regulations stipulates that \"Any vessels not engaged in fishing shall, when under way, keep out of the way of any vessels fishing with nets or lines or trawls.\" Rule 89 provides further that \"Nothing in these Rules shall exonerate any vessel, or the owner, master or crew thereof, from the consequences of any neglect to keep a proper lookout, or of the neglect of any precaution which may be required by the ordinary practice of seamen, . . . \" As the incident occurred in a fishing area very near to the coast and the weather was clear with extended visibility, and the fishing boot \"No. 3 Shun Hslng\" was also lighted, the 8.8. \"Pyrrhus\" should be held responsible for the neglect of preouation which led to the collision and should pay compensation for the damage. 6. The items enumerated in the list of damage to the equipment and possessions of the damaged fishing boat ( see en� closure C) were checked and verified on the spot and were estimated at a total of NT$110,040 at current market price. The fishing boat ceased operation after it was damaged by the collision but the mteter and the crew had received their pay from the owner as usual and the loss during the period in which fishing operation was discontinued amounted to MT$30 ,000 a month. It has now been confirmed that the fishing boat was suspended from operation for 69 days from June 4, the date of the collision, to August 11, when it was repaired, thus incurring a total loss of NT$69 ,000. This together with the loss from damage to the boat itself, amounting to NT#179,040 in all, should be paid by the owners of the 8.8. \"Pyrrhus\". 6. The enclosures mentioned above are enclosed herewith, and you are requested to handle this matter urgently with a view to obtaining at an early date the full amount of compensation for the damaged party, as stated in pare 5 of this letter.

A report was submitted to this government by Helen tiu- huan, a fisherman in this hslen, concerning his damaged fishing boat Which states, inter alia, that: \"I have to report that on June 2, 1964 at 12.00 p.m. the \"No. 3 Shun Hslng\", a 40 h.p. 17.99 ton fishing boat owned by me, set sail and arrived after some three hours on the sea in a fishing area for long line fishing of sharks and that on the next day, June 4, at about 8.00 a.m. the boat was lighted and anchored opposite Taoyuan Helen ( the position where the collision occurred) and the ten crew members were assembled on the front deck busily engaged In arrang� ing the long line fishing gear and in putting the belt on to the hooks Whenafter about 40 minutes or around 4.00 a.m. a British iron- hull vessel ( known to be a British vessel only after the crew were rescued) appeared suddenly and struck with the boat at the stern with full force. All the crew were Instantly thrown off balance with their feet upward and the boat made a 180 turn, reversing the position of her bow. Waves poured into the damaged stern during the turn and the boat begun to sink. It was fortunate that all the crew were working on the bow and were thus not drowned ( all the crew would have perished If they were sleeping in the crew's cabin at that time). The crew members were in any case terrified and shouted and screamed, end Chen Shu-hslng, a member of the crew standing by the beacon light, quickly pulled the light down and swung it vigorously as signals to request rescue. The signals were seen by the British vessel several minutes later and as it came neur to the fishing boat lifeboats were lowered to pick up the crew. The master of the fishing boat, Ksieh Chang- teen, then pointed out to the master of the British vessel his mistake anti demanded full Indemnity for the damage caused but hie expressions were not clearly understood owing to language differences. An interpreter of the British vessel ( who looked like a Chinese) then declared. \"This vessel *111 accept every responsibility for the collision and will write a letter which can be presented to the British consulate in Taiwan and other authorities concerned for payment of compensa� tion\", thereby ending the negotiations . At b.uO a.m. on the same day we encountered the \"Tal-yu No.6\", a fishing boat belonging to the Keelung Marine products Company, on the water off Chu-nan and were taken on board the fishing boat for repatriation. On the return journey we met the rescue ship the \"No. 3 Chen- ban\", sent out jointly by the Hsln-chu Helen Fishery Association and other authorities concerned, on the sea opposite Tao-yuan Helen at 4.00 p.m. and were transferred to the ship arriving at the harbour at 11.00 p.m. The sunken fishing boat ( the \"No. 3 3hun Hslng\") was found by another rescue party consisting of the \"Foo- ohin\", the \"Chu-yu\" and the \"No. 6 Chen-han\" and was towed back to the harbour at 6.30 a,m. the next day. The damaged portions of the fishing boat were Immediately photographed for evidence.

An interpreter of the British vessel ( who looked like a Chinese ) then declared; \"This vessel will accept every responsibility for the collision and will write a letter which can be presented to the British Consulate in Taiwan ana other authorities concerned for payment of compensation\" , theiety ending the negotiations. At 6.U0 a.m. on the same day we encountered the \"Tai-yu No. 6\", a fishing bout belonging to the Kcelunu kurine irocucts Company, on the water off Chu-nan and were taken on board the fishing boat for repatriation, on the return Journey we met the rescue ship the \"No. 3 Chen- hen\" , sent out jointly by the Haln-chu Helen Fishery Association and other authorities concerned, on the sea opposite Tao-yuan Helen at 4.00 p.m. and were transferred to the ship arriving at the harbour at 11.00 p.m. The sunken fishing boat ( the \"No. 3 Uhun Hslng\") was spotted by another resoure party consisting of the \"Foo-chin\" , the \"Chu-yu\" and the \"No. 6 Chen-han\" and was towed back to the harbour at 5.30 a.m. the next day.

Taiwan Provincial Government, Taipei, Taiwan. December 2, 1954. Sir, I have the honour to refer to your letter No. 460/1/24/64 of June 26 in reply to a letter from Mr. Teal Wen-yu, Chairman of the Taiwan Pishing Association, on the subject of the collision of the British vessel 8.8. \"Pyrrhus\" with a Formosan trawler, \"No. 3 8hun Hsing,\" on June 4th 1964. In that letter you stated that the British shipping authorities had been requested to investigate the incident, and asked that full details, a list of damage suffered by the trawler, and a copy of a document written by the Master of the British vessel be sent to you through this Government. 2. After the accident , an on-the-spot inveatigation was held Jointly by the Fishery Administration of the provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, the Hsln-chu Hsien Government and other authorities concerned and the findings, together with photographs showing the fishing boat in its damaged condition ( see enclosure A), a report made by the owner of the fishing boat ( see enclosure B) and a list of damage to the equipment and possessions of the fishing boat ( see enclosure C) , were submitted to this Government. The master of the fishing boat was also asked, in accordance with the maritime law and other relevant Chinese regulations, to submit a maritime report (see enclosure D) to the Maritime Committee of the Keelung Harbour Bureau for deliberation according to low and regulations. The veraict ( see enclosure M) reached by the Committee after an investigation had been made by the experts, and the minutes of two maritime interrogations ( see enclosure F) , were presented to this Government through the Keelung Harbour Bureau on August 6th. 3. As is evident from the verdict reached and from the investigations made by the various authorities and experts mentioned above, the fishing boat, prior to the collision, was not in fact an \"unlighted vessel\" as alleged by the master of the British vessel 8.8. \"Pyrrhus\" in his document written in English ( see enclosure O). According to the testimonials by the chief of the Nan-liao Li, hsln-chu City, ana the rescuing fishing boat despatched by the Hsln-chu Hsien Fishery Association (see enclosure H ) , the light on the outside of the master's cabin was still not extinguished. The minutes of the maritime Interrogations made by the Keelung Harbour Bureau during the investigation also recorded that the fishing boat was lighted and engaged in fishing when the collision occurred. The Bureau declared, after completing the investigation which was conducted by experts, that: T'The fishing boat's front light and the aft light support were still there and electric wiring ana switches remained intact. The two batteries were also examined and found to be still charged with electricity. The navigation experts who studied the maritime report of the fishing boat and the minutes of Interrogations upon invitation by this Bureau were all of the opinion that it was impossible to prove that the fishing boat was not lighted at that time. And according to Kang aheng-ohun, master of the fishing boat \"Tai-yu No. 6\" who himself saw it, many small line-fishing vessels were engaged in fishing on the sea near Hsin-ohu on that night ( all vessels wars lighted) and the weather was clear with extensive visibility.

As the document given by the master of the British vessel was written in English, the master and the crew of the damaged fishing boat, who were not conversant with the English language, were unable to voice immediately their objection to the point in question. 4. It will be recalled that the British Government invited the Republic of China and other nations in 1948 to a conference in London where \"The International Regulations for preventing Colli� sions at Sea 1948\" were drafted. These regulations were subse� quently adopted by the various governments and put into force on January 1st, 1964. Rule 36 of the Regulations stipulates that \"Any vessels not engaged in fishing shall, when under way, keep out of the way of any vessels fishing with nets or lines or trawls.\" Rule 29 provides further that \"Nothing in these Rules shall exonerate any vessel, or the owner, master or crew thereof, from the consequences of any neglect to keep a proper lookout, or of the neglect of any precaution which may be required by the ordinary practice of seamen, \" As the incident occurred in a fishing area very near to the coast and the weather was clear with extended visibility, and the fishing boot \"No. 3 Shun Hsing\" was also lighted, the S. S. \"Pyrrhus\" should be held responsible for the neglect of preouation which led to the collision and should pay compensation for the damage. 6. The items enumerated in the list of damage to the equipment and possessions of the damaged fishing boat ( see en� closure C) were checked and verified on the spot and were estimated at a total of NT|110,040 at current market price. The fishing boat ceased operation after it was damaged by the collision but the master and the crew had received their pay from the owner as usual and the loss during the period in which fishing operation was discontinued amounted to BT#30,000 a month. It has now been confirmed that the fishing boat was suspended from operation for 69 days from June 4, the date of the collision, to August 11, when it was repaired, thus incurring a total lose of NT$69,000. This together with the loss from damage to the boat Itself, amounting to NT$179,040 in all, should be paid by the owners of the 8.8. \"Pyrrhus\". 6. The enclosures mentioned above are enclosed herewith, and you are requested to handle this matter urgently with a view to obtaining at an early date the full amount of compensation for the damaged party, as stated in pare 6 of this letter.

All the crew were instantly thrown off balance with their feet upward and the boat made a 180 turn, reversing the position of her bow. Waves poured into the damaged stern during the turn and the boat began to sink. It was fortunate that all the crew were working on the bow and were thus not drowned ( all the crew would have perished if they were sleeping in the crew's cabin at that time). The crew members were in any case terrified and shouted and screamed, and Chen 3hu-hsing, a member of the o row standing by the beacon light, quickly pulled the light down and swung it vigorously as signals to request rescue. The signals were seen by the British vessel several minutes later and as it came near to the fishing boat lifeboats were lowered to pick up the crew. The master of the fishing boat , Hsieh Chang- teen, then pointed out to the master of the British vessel his mistake one* demanded full indemnity for the damage caused but his expressions were not clearly understood owing to language differences. An interpreter of the British vessel ( who looked like a Chinese) then declared. \"This vessel will accept every responsibility for the collision and will write a letter which can be presented to the British Consulate in Taiwan and other authorities concerned for payment of compensa� tion\" , thereby ending the negotiations. At 6.00 a.m. on the same day we encountered the \"Tai-yu No. 6\", a fishing boat belonging to the Keelung Marine Products Company, on the water off Chu-nan and were taken on board the fishing boat for repatriation. On the return journey we met the rescue ship the \"No. 3 Chen-han\", sent out jointly by the Heln-chu Hsian Fishery Association and other authorities concerned, on the sea opposite Tao-yuan Helen at 4.00 p.m. and were transferred to the ship arriving at the harbour at 11.00 p.m. The sunken fishing boat ( the \"No. 3 Shun Hsing\") was found by another rescue party consisting of the \"Foo- ohin\", the \"Chu-yu\" and the \"No# 6 Chen-han\" and was towed back to the harbour at (A 30 a,m. the next day.

A maritime report of the fishing boat \"ho. 3 iihun lining\" . The \"No. 3 tihun Helng\" ( 40 h.p. , 17.7b ton) pulled out from Nan-llao harbour on June 2, 1954 at 12.00 p.m. for a fishing trip and arrived after some three hours In a fishing area for long line fishing of sharks. At about 3.00 a.m. on the next day, June 4, the boat was lighted and anchored opposite Tao-yuan Helen ( the position where the collision occurred) and the crew of ten were assembled on the front deck busily engaged in arranging the long line fishing gear and in putting the bait on to the hooks . After some 40 minutes or about 4.00 a.m. the British iron-hull vessel ( known to be a British vessel only after the crew were rescued) appeared suddenly and struck the boat at the stern with full force. All the crew were immediately thrown off balance with their feet pointing skyward and the boot made a 100� turn reversing the original position of her bow. Waves poured into the damaged stern and the boat began to e ink into the sea. It was fortunate that all the crew were working on the bow end were thus not drowned (all the crew would have perished if they were sleeping in the crew's cabin at that time) . The crew members were in any case terrified and shouted and screamed, and Chen Lhul-hslng, a member of the crew standing near the beacon light, quickly pulled the light down end swung it vigorously as signals to request rescue. The signals were seen by the British vessel several minutes later and as it came near to the fishing boat lifeboats were lowered to pick up the crew. The master of the fishing boat, Hsleh Chang- teen, then pointed out to the master of the British vessel his mistake and demanded full indemnity for the damage caused but his expressions were not clearly understood owing to language differences. An interpreter of the British vessel ( who looked like a Chinese ) then declared: \"This vessel will accept every responsibility for the collision and will write a letter which can be presented to the British Consulate in Taiwan and other authorities concerned for payment of compensation\" , theieby ending the negotiations. At 5. JO a.m. on the same day we encountered the \"Tai-yu No. 6\", a fishing boat belonging to the keelun Marine Products Company, on the water off Chu-nan and were taken on board the fishing boat for repatriation. On the return Journey we met the rescue ship the \"No. 3 Chen- hen\" , sent out jointly by the llsin-chu Hsien Fishery Association and other authorities concerned, on the sea opposite Tao-yuan Helen at 4.00 p.m. and were transferred to the ship arriving at the harbour at 11.00 p.m. The sunken fishing boat ( the \"No. 3 tihun Using\") was spotted by another resoure party consisting of the \"Poo-chi n\" , the \" Chu-yu\" and the \"No. 6 Chen-han\" and was towed bock to the harbour at 5.30 a.m. the next day.

In that letter you stated that the British shipping authorities had been requested to Investigate the incident, and asked that full details, a list of damage suffered by the trawler, and a copy of a document written by the Master of the British vessel be sent to you through this Government. 2. After the accident, an on-the-spot investigation was held jointly by the Fishery Administration of the provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, the Hsin-chu Helen Government and other authorities concerned and the findings, together with photographs showing the fishing boat in its damaged condition ( see enclosure A), a report made by the owner of the fishing boat ( see enclosure B) and a list of damage to the equipment and possessions of the fishing boat ( see enclosure 0) , were submitted to this Government. The master of the fishing boat was also asked, in accordance with the maritime law and other relevant Chinese regulations, to submit a maritime report (see enclosure D) to the Maritime Committee of the Keelung Harbour Bureau for deliberation according to law and regulations. The verdict ( see enclosure E) reached by the Committee after an Investigation had been made by the experts, and the minutes of two maritime interrogations ( see enclosure F), were presented to this Government through the Keelung Harbour Bureau on August 6th. 5. As Is evident from the verdict reached and from the Investigations made by the various authorities and experts mentioned above, the fishing boat, prior to the collision, was not In fact an \"unllghted vessel\" as alleged by the master of the British vessel 8.8. \"Pyrrhus\" In his document written In English ( see enclosure 0). According to the testimonials by the chief of the Nan-llao LI, Hsin-chu City, and the rescuing fishing boat despatched by the Hsin-chu Helen Fishery Association (see enclosure H) , the light on the outside of the master's eabin was still not extinguished. The minutes of the maritime Interrogations made by the Keelung Harbour Bureau during the investigation also recorded that the fishing boat was lighted and engaged in fishing when the collision occurred. The Bureau declared, after completing the investigation which was conducted by experts, that; \"The fishing boat's front light and the aft light support were still there and electric wiring and switches remained intact. The two batteries were also examined and found to be still charged with electricity. The navigation experts who studied the maritime report of the fishing boat and the minutes of interrogations upon invitation by this Bureau were all of the opinion that it was impossible to prove that the fishing boat was not lighted at that time.

All the crew were instantly thrown off balance with their feet upward and the boat made a 180 turn, reversing the position of her bow. Waves poured into the damaged stern during the turn and the boat began to sink. It was fortunate that all the crew were working on the bow and were thus not drowned ( all the crew would have perished if they were sleeping in the crew's cabin at that time). The crew members were in any case terrified and shouted and screamed, and Chen Shu-hslng, a member of the crew standing by the beacon light, quickly pulled the light down and swung it vigorously as signals to request rescue. The signals were seen by the British vessel several minutes later and as it came near to the fishing boat lifeboats were lowered to pick up the crew. The master of the ?

The electric wiring and the switches were left intact and the two batteries were found to be still charged with elec� tricity. The maritime report of the fishing boat and the minutes of the interrogations were studied by the navigation experts invited by this Bureau , and they were all of the opinion that it was impossible to prove that the lights of the fishing boat were not lit at the time of the collision. According to Kang Sheng-chun, master of the fishing boat \"Tai-yu No. 6\" who sighted the scene, many mall line fishing vessels were engaged in fishing on the sea near Hsin-chu on that night ( all vessels were lighted ) and the weather was clear with great degree of visibility. The British vessel was sailing quite near to the coast and should have paid special precaution.

Thank you tee^yew- Letter* tmeSTZ^TinJanuary about the Formosan claim against the \"Pyrrhus\". 2. As it happened, I had, after consultation with the other Divisions concerned here , prepared a very short despatch in reply to H.M. Consul's despatch dated 23rd December. A copy is enclosed. Although H.M. Consul addressed his despatch to Mr. Boyd-Carpenter , it may be that, since the proposed reply contains instructions as to the response that H.M. Consul should make to the Formosan authorities' approach, it should more properly go from the Foreign Office. The reply accords , I think, with the position set out in your letter - viz. that the claim is one between private parties , which should not be presented and cannot be handled through governmental channels (at any rate at this stage). Perhaps you will let me know of any amendments you suggest and of your views . as to the originating Department. 3. A wreck report about this collision has been received in this Department from the authorities in Hong Kong. . The wreck report is confidential to the Minister in practice. For your. own oonfi- ^ dential information I attach a copy of the relevant extract of the \"Pyrrhus\" Master's report as telegraphed by the Hong Kong government. On receipt of the report it was decided not to take further action; this is usual in collision oases , which generally go to litigation. D. C.

We have three Affidavits which have been recently made (two in Hong- Kong and one in Liverpool) concerning the collision and we under� stand that further Affidavits will be secured from the Second and Fourth Officers as soon as they can be brought, wherever they new are located, before an official to make an oath. It is to be noted, of course, that tale accident took place in June last year and in the meantime the personnel on beard the 'Pyrrhus* have been scattered. The standard of Blue runnel navigation and alertness is known to all in the shipping world and, quite apart from the Affidavits it Is net within reason that � Pyrrhus\" could have failed to sight a lighted vessel, especially in an area where the presence of other fishing beats would have made them especially watchAil. > e are confident that you will be convinced (as we are In fast convinced), after esamlnlng the Affidavits and reading what we have to say, that the true facts are as put forward on behalf of the \"Pyrrhus* .

It is to be noted that the bell was rung a very short time before the collision actually took place, and though this does net, of course, completely demonstrate the Lookout's story to bo the true one, it is certainly corroborat� ive of it in that it demonstrates the alertness of the Lookout in V1","image_file":"035940.jpg","image_url":"http://www.archivesdirect.amdigital.co.uk/Documents/Images/115150/77","book_id":"115150"},{"id":"79page","position":79,"hasModel":"Page","image_text":"n n n -i q u u u i O %a/ .eelug the Junk before the eolilelon and before any occupant of the junk sew the \"i vrrhua\". xfter the veesel struck, there wee a deal of shouting and commotion and the erew started to light flares. what happened after the collision la clearly set out in the Master* e Affidavit and that of the 3rd Fireman It is significant that though the Affidavits of the Lookout end the 3rd fireman were made mere or less at the sane time (one in Liverpool and the other in Hong long) and in any event it la impossible that the 3rd fireman could have had any contact with the Able Seaman as to what should be incorporated in their respective Affidavits, nevertheless, what the 3rd Fireman states he was told by the fishermen themselves is definitely corroborative of the Lookout' s story, namely t that the fishermen admitted that they had been asleep at the tine of the collision. This is, of course, singularly corroborative of the Lookout* e statement that there was no sign of life - me shouting before the oellielon but much shouting and commotion after, hven if one aan had bean awake on board the fishing vessel, It is inconceivable that in the sain weather than existing he would not have heard or seen something of the \"Pyrrhus\" (a ship of 10,093 tone gross register) with all her lights and engines throbbing prior to the collision and would have shouted a warning to the vessel before the collision actually took place. AS to the alleged conversation, it is easy to see how a mis� understanding could have arisen, but it obviously stands to reason that the Master would not have written a letter denying liability and at the sane tins admitted it verbally. The Third Fireman in fact made no premises (and had no authority to do so) but was merely pointing out that nothing could be done about their claims in mid-ocean. Language difficulties were probably responsible for any mi sunders tand- ln,� Whilst regretting that this should have happened, the fault in fact lies with the fishermen themselves and no blame whatsoever attaches to the \"Pyrrhus\".

It was a very dark night but it was clear and visibility was good Shortly before 4 a.m. on the 4th day of June 1934 I sighted a dark shape right ahead of and very close to the \"Pyrrhus. \" This dark shape which I assumed to be a junk was showing no lights whatsoever and all I could see was the faint outline of her hull and there was no sign of life on board the junk nor was there any shouting or sound from her before the \"Pyrrhus\" collided with her. I immediately went to the bell on the forecastle head of the \"Pyrrhus\" to strike it three times which would report to the Officers on watch on the bridge of the \"Pyrrhus\" that there was a vessel right ahead and as I struck the bell the third time the \"Pyrrhus\" collided with the junk near her stern Immediately after the \"Pyrrhus\" had collided with the junk I heard a lot of shouting and a commotion coming from the junk and her crew started to light flares. These flares were the only lights shown by the junk at any time and they were not lit until after the collision. 3 v 0 R K by the said Patrick Joseph He anion at Liverpool in the County of Lancaster the Fourteenth day of January 1954 Before me J.

Collision between ooden Motor fiohln# Vessel No. ) (-Phun Mslntf\" ) nnd the e. s.\" Pyrrhus w on the 4th June, 1994. I, ARTHUR KIHCwk Y SANDaR8vW, care of Alfred Holt * Coopony Liverpool, make oath and say as follows; 1. I am the Master of the s. e. \"Pyrrhus'' (Port of ke�letry i Liverpool ) end was such Master also on the 4th June, 1994. 2. In the early hours of the 4th June, 1994, before daylight the said vessel was proceeding down the J traits of Formosa on a voyage from Kobe to Hong Kong. Be night was fine and clear with no soon. 9. I was awakened by the fact that the engines were stopped at approximately 0400 hours or a little before. 2 Immediately got up and was preparing to proceed to the bridge when I was called and informed that the s. e. \"Pyrrhus\" had hit an unlighted wooden fishing vessel two or three minutes previously. 4. I proceeded immediately to the bridge and there observed (by then ooeeibly a quarter of u mile on our port quarter) what appeared to be a dryeell torch being waved and this was accompanied by shouting and other noises. 9. I immediately gave orders to turn about with a view to doing what could be done t > save life and property as might be necessary. At the same time I ordered the motor Hfeooat to be prepared for lowering. 6. There were on the bridge during the middle watch the ! eoond officer and another subordinate Tffloer; in addition, there were three Ratings on duty-a lookout on the fo'c'ale head, a Quartermaster on the bridge and a standby. The iffioer of the watoh informed me that the vessel had been aaaalng vessels fishing for some time and in consider� able quantity and for this reason the radar had been switched on, and I myself then observed the lights of approximately 12 fiehln* vessels which were then visible. The Officer of the Watch then informed me that neither he nor any of the men on the bridge had seen anything of the vessel which the Pyrrhus\" had just hit prior to the collision occurring, from the bridge they had heard the lookout on the fo'o'sle sound three bells indicating an object immediately ahead and that be� fore any helm or telegraph notion could be taken the vyrrhue had come into contact with the vessel. Immediately thereupon the engines had been stopped. 7. hen wo came to the vicinity of the waving light the motor lifeboat was lowered and proceeded to the assistance of the men on the vessel with wnloh the \"Pyrrhus\" had come Into collision. I was able myself to see in the dark that this was a fishing vessel (apparently wooden) of approximately 19 to 20 tons and that the vessel was down by the stem to such an extent as to raise the forefoot of the now above the water. I was convinced that the vessel would remain afloat, the see then being extremely calm and there being no wind. 8. 10 men wore taken by our motor life cat from this partly sub� merged vessel and brought aboard the \" yrrhus\". They were all dry and brought no bt longings with them. #e offered them food and tea. They declined the food but did later partake of tea. 9. I was anxious to find out whether any fatalities or casualties had taken place on board this vessel and 1 sent for the ho.l fireman of our vessel to ascertain whether he or any of the Chinese men working with him were able to speak or understand the dialect which these rescued men spoke. None of the rescued men spoke a word of trvilieh, though the man whom I took to be the Master produced to me a bundle of, apparently, ship's papers which skewed the vessel's complement (as 1 gathered from the fact that 10 photographs were attached) to be 10 only, including the Master. 10. After picking up the 10 men, I gave instructions for a radio message to be transmitted advising of the position in which this semi-submerged vessel lay. & N) H o I m u> 1 -4 d o > i-* VI 5 V) m e (/> II M","image_file":"035944.jpg","image_url":"http://www.archivesdirect.amdigital.co.uk/Documents/Images/115150/81","book_id":"115150"},{"id":"83page","position":83,"hasModel":"Page","image_text":"n n n o p u u u O C HONG KONG - 2 - 1 S � The Wo.l fire* am produced a man vho appeared to be able to comreree with the reaoued men and who alee apoke paaeably good ngiieh, and through him I vaa Informed that all men were uninjured, and that the 10 men rescued ware the total of the persona on board the flatting vaaael.

However, toward# daylight (which waa probably not more than half an hour after thla) I noticed that there waa, amongat the fiahing veaaele in our vicinity aa we paaaed, a ateel a team trawler and I decided that If the 10 men were agreeable to going, it vaa far preferable not to take thea with me to Hong Kong but to traaefer them to thla trawler.

I put the letter or certificate into an envelope addr*aaed to the Mrltlab Coneul in Taiwan. 14. I wrote the letter and hand'd it to the Haater and the tranefer of them to the trawler waa auoceawfully achieved. A copy of the letter which I wrote to the rltiah Coneul la included in the oorreapondence which hae been received from f srmeaa. It, of courae, merely recorded the collision with an unlighted veeael and did not in any way aanume any liability on the yrrhua* pan. he \" Fyrrhua\" then proceeded on it# Journey to Hong ong. 13.

Throughout the whole proceeding and, in fact, until todav, I have been firmly of the opinion that there waa ao allegation at all by even the euaeerged veaael 'a Master and rev that the veaael waa prior to the collision a lighted veaael. 16. Later after the 10 men had been transferred to the at earn trawler, I found out from the fe*c*ale head lookout ( P. J. Scanlon) what had traneplred. He informed me that, though ke ping a keen look out ahead, he had aeee nothing except a dark ahape right ahead Juat before the colli� sion. He etated that there were no lights visible.

S. \"Pyrrhus\" in an English court. This is because the agents here of the Blue Funnel Line, Messrs. Butterfield and Swire, are now being pressed not only by the Provincial Government but also by the Nationalist Ministry of Communications to settle the claim, and if they do not do so the intention is clearly to sue them in a Formosan court. I do not know whether its own law grants such a court jurisdiction over this kind of case, nor whether, if so, the owners' agents can legally be held responsible; but I have little doubt that the law will if necessary be adjusted. 3� I have not much hope that my explanation of the right to sue in England, and reference to the theoretical independence in Formosa of the judiciary, will do anything to avert the victimisation of Butterfield and Swire. I rather expect that this will turn out a nasty case, and that the initial refusal to negotiate a settlement, though fully justified, will cost someone a good deal of money. I will, however, watch it closely, and do everything possible to safeguard Butterfield and Swire's interests. 4.

Letter No. 46164/44. Taiwan Provincial Government , May 6, 1955. Subject : Renewal of request for assistance in reaching a settlement of the Trawler Shun Using No. 3' s claim against S. S. Pyrrhus with respect to a collision. Sir, I have the honour to refer to your letter No. 12706/4/55 of March 9, 1955, on the subject of damages sustained by Trawler Shun Hsing No. 3 in collision with the British vessel Pyrrhus. You state in this letter that the Government of the United Kingdom considers that it is a private case which should be pursued in a court of the United Kingdom. 2. As the trawler concerned is a small one and the owner is a small-scale fisherman, it is financially impossible for him to proceed to the United Kingdom and file a lawsuit which may be protracted. Furthermore, the fact that the trawler sustained damage is self-evident, and it would be illogical either from a legal or from a humanitarian point of view to disclaim any responsibility in the matter when a vessel with modern navigational apparatus rammed and destroyed a small wooden fishing craft incapable of taking any action to save itself. 3. Furthermore, in any dispute, it is the practice to try to reach an agreement before legal proceedings are undertaken. The work of the British Consulate is to deal with affairs involving British nationals including com� mercial and shipping matters. In your letter No. 450/1, 24/54 of June 25, 1954 to the Taiwan Fishermen's Association you expressed your sympathy, and it is therefore requested that, on the grounds of humanity and sympathy for distressed fishermen, you use your good offices to reach a settlement with the owners of 3.3. Pyrrhus , to enable this case to be brought to an early conclusion and prevent it from having an unfortunate effect on public opinion.
