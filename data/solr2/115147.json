CONFIDENTIAL 0 GO. REF: Q. 2235/72/55 Fc /364/a ^ You will have \\ y You will have seen from the Commissioner-General' s telegram No. 366 to the Foreign Office of the l6th of April that he saw Chou-en-Lai for a few minutes at Singapore airport when the latter went through on his way to the Bandoeng Conferenoe. 2. We had, through the airport authorities, about half an hour's advance warning of the aircraft's arrival, and there is some slight nystery about why it came. Air India authorities told me that the pilot said they had been nine hours in the air since leaving Rangoon, and had almost reached Djakarta when a high bad weather front which the Skymaster could not get over forced it back and that petrol was running low by the time it reached Singapore. While they were at the airport numerous messages were exchanged with Nehru's Constellation, which offered to come in and take than on, but finally Chou himself decided in my hearing to decline the offer. The curious thing is that the meteorological people here say that the weather was not particularly bad that day, and it has been suggested by our American colleagues here that Chou had an ulterior motive in wishing to come to Singapore. However, as it took us five minutes to persuade him and his party to leave the plane on arrival, I am fairly sure that there was no ulterior motive and it may simply have been that the pilot of the aircraft was over� anxious not to take ary possible risk of having harm come to his precious cargo. I do not think that the interview he had with the Air India investigator, reported in our telegrams Nos. 372 and ( vi 383 the 17th and the 19th of April respectively was premeditated. 3.
